App should be written using Plain JavaScript & HTML
Create a Simple Paint App using HTML5 Canvas Element that lets users draw Triangles on the canvas by clicking & dragging the mouse - like in Windows Paint App.
Size of Triangles should depend on how much the user drags the mouse.

Add a clear / reset button that clears the canvas
